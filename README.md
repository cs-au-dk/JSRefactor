JSRefactor
==========

Experimental refactoring tools for JavaScript. This project explores the possibility of using points-to information as the foundation for refactoring logic.

Main projects:
 - jsparser: a parser for JavaScript with a useful AST
 - jscontrolflow: control-flow graphs for JavaScript
 - jspointers: pointer analysis for JavaScript
 - jsrefactoring: refactoring logic

Auxiliary projects:
 - jsutil: some stuff all projects need
 - jtidy-js: hacked version of jtidy, needed to extract JavaScript from HTML files
 - benchmarks: refactoring benchmarks used in the OOPSLA'11 paper

 - Asger Feldthaus: jsparser, jscontrolflow, jspointers, jsrefactoring
