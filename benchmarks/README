These are the benchmarks used for evaluating our refactorings.

They are grouped into four subdirectories: 10k/ for entries from the
10K apart contest, chrome/ for Chrome experiments, msie/ for MSIE
Testdrive benchmarks, and google/ for some Google benchmarks.

For evaluation purposes, the benchmarks have been modified in the
following way:
  - Several benchmarks have annotations of the form "/* module M */"
    and "/* end M */" to facilitate testing of the Extract Module
    refactoring; refactored versions of these benchmarks are stored
    in the extracted/ subdirectories

    The current version of Extract Module does strange things to
    whitespace. Hence the whitespace in the refactored versions is
    not always where you would expect it to be. Also, in some
    benchmarks spurious semicolons were inserted to work around
    deficiencies in the automated testing setup (_not_ the
    implementation itself!).
  - In some benchmarks, top-level function definitions have
    been reordered to group related functions together; the
    implementation does not support this at the moment, but care has
    been taken to only perform reorderings that the implementation
    could easily prove to be behaviour preserving
    flatwar.html, apophis.html, bomomo.html
  - In some benchmarks, extra semicolons have been inserted at the end
    of event handler code in HTML; this is due to purely technical
    reasons: the JavaScript code is extracted and written to a
    temporary file; if the semicolon is missing, that code might be
    ill-formed.
