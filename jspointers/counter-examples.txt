Collection of analysis "killers" found in real-world (or semi-real-world) code:

From test/10k/lines.html
	In global scope, we have:
		var p = document,A = "getElementById";
	and then p[A] is used to access document.getElementById throughout the code.
	
From test/10k/nbody.html:
	function clone(obj) {
	    if (obj == null || typeof(obj) != 'object')
	        return obj;
	
	    var temp = new obj.constructor();
	    for (var key in obj)
	        temp[key] = clone(obj[key]);
	
	    return temp;
	}
