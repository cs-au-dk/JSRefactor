CORE FEATURES

Detect use of eval and the Function constructor. We can't handle it, but we can detect it.

Implement StoreIfPresent's transfer function properly. Right now it works like Store, which is less precise
than it could be (but is sound).

PRAGMATIC STUFF

Look into non-standard features, such as the __proto__ property being accessible directly, and add support for these.
Preliminary list:
	__proto__
	substr 

DOM Modeling:

"Element" is used in TAJS/test/10k/10k_snake.html, but the analysis does not know it.

ECMA 5

- get/set properties in object literals.
